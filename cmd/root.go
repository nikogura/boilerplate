Code Generation Tool.

You can create a project any old way, including writing every file from scratch. Sometimes, however, you have better things to do with your time, and just want to get something working.  Other times you might have less sophisticated users that need to be able to get *something* up and running in a standard way without having to know all the ins and outs of your build system.

The "boilerplate" tool is intended to create a minimally usable codebase so you can get on to the real task of solving problems.
